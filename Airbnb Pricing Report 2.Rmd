# Summary Report: Linear Regression Analysis on Airbnb New York Listings
#
# This analysis investigates the factors influencing the price of Airbnb listings in New York, using a linear regression model. 
# The primary aim was to understand how various room types and neighbourhood groups contribute to the variation in listing prices. 
# The dataset, obtained from Airbnb, was preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables, which were converted to 
# factors and one-hot encoded.
#
# The regression model included key variables such as room type (Entire home/apt, Hotel room, Private room, and Shared room) and 
# neighbourhood group (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island). The analysis revealed significant relationships 
# between the listing price and certain predictors. Notably, "Hotel room" and "Entire home/apt" were associated with substantial 
# increases in price, with coefficients of 274.73 and 158.09, respectively. Manhattan also showed a strong positive relationship 
# with price, with an increase of 158.50 compared to the reference neighbourhood group. However, other factors such as "Private room" 
# and "Shared room" as well as certain neighbourhood groups like the Bronx and Queens had limited or no significant effect on pricing.
#
# The model's R-squared value was quite low at 0.00816, indicating that only a small portion of the variance in listing prices 
# is explained by the included variables. This suggests the presence of additional unaccounted-for factors influencing the price of 
# Airbnb listings, such as amenities, review scores, or geographical location specifics. The low R-squared also points to potential 
# multicollinearity among some predictors, particularly with regard to neighbourhood group variables, as indicated by the removal 
# of certain categories (e.g., "Shared room" and "Staten Island") due to singularities in the regression model.
#
# Residual analysis showed no major violations of model assumptions. The residuals appeared evenly distributed around zero, and 
# the Q-Q plot indicated that the residuals followed a normal distribution. While the model fit could be improved by incorporating 
# additional features such as listing amenities, review scores, and geographical data, the current analysis offers valuable 
# insights into the key factors affecting Airbnb prices in New York.
#
# Overall, while the model provides some useful insights into the price determinants for Airbnb listings, further refinement 
# through additional variables and possibly more advanced modeling techniques would likely enhance its explanatory power and 
# predictive accuracy.
